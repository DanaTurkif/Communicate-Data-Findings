# Communicate-Data-Findings

 I analyzed the Ford GoBike system dataset and
 - most of the bike rides we on Friday, Thursday and Wednesday it was slightly different for
This Dataset contains information about bike
 rides during may 2019, and by analyzing the data I found out that:
  customers and subscribers where subscribers are more active everyday other than Saturday
 and Sunday while customers are seem to have regular patterns except that bike rides on Friday
 are more frequent than other days.
 - Most of the bike rides are done on 8AM or 6PM and I found out that customers rides are
 usually longer and travel longer distances than subscribers.
- Customers rides are usually longer (longer duration) than subscribers’’.
